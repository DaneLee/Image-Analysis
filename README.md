# Image-Analysis
This was an undergrad project that was done mainly for learning purposes. The project's aim was to analyze patterns with images of salt deposits in an attempt to see if salts could be differentiated from non-salt. 
The programming language used in this project was python as it was the best option for carrying out the complex computation which included linear algebra and mulitvariable calculus. 
The some parts of the code work properly as the functions were used with the Spyder console inorder to carry out the computational operation on the images.
